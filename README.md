# Simplify
Simplify is a small mod that simplifies those long annoying to type out commands!

Right now there is only a few features, attribute commands and a simple mob summoner and custom item giver but I plan to add more as time goes on.

Start with /Simplify and it will give you a command list!

Commands:

/MaxHealth - Changes Max Health for Player/Entity

/Damage - Changes damage for Player/Entity

/Knockback - Changes how far a Player/Entity can hit something

/KnockbackResist - Changes how much knockback is applied to the Player/Entity

/Armor - Changes how much armor a Player/Enitity has

/SimplifyGive - Opens a simple item giver for the Player

/SimplifySummon - Opens a simple mob summoner for the Player

/Rename - Renames the item in your main hand

/Skull - Gives you a player's head
